HenricoCrime
============

This is a site I developed as a personal project back in 2007. Similar to sites for Chicago and Richmond, 
it displayed crime incident info on a map. I got the data by scraping the HCPD's public information search form.

At some point it stopped working (as scrapers often do) and as I had moved out of the county and into Richmond City, 
I took down the site.  Henrico County now provides [official web services](http://randolph.co.henrico.va.us/public-data-access/webservices/default.aspx), so hopefully the scraper will
no longer be necessary.

So this is provided mainly as a historical curiosity :)
