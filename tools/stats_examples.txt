This one would be how to get the crime category name
from the code number.

SELECT DISTINCT offense_code, offense_text, 
FLOOR(offense_code/100) AS cat, 
offense_categories.description 
FROM incident 
LEFT JOIN offense_categories 
ON category = FLOOR(offense_code/100) 
WHERE offense_code <= 2699;

This one gets the number of incidents in a particular
category.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM incident
WHERE FLOOR(offense_code/100) = ???;

Get a count of all the incidents by category, with category names.
Last row is the total.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, categories.description
FROM incident 
LEFT JOIN categories
ON category = FLOOR(offense_code/100)
WHERE begin_time BETWEEN '2006-09-04 00:00:00' AND '2006-09-04 23:59:59'
AND offense_code <= 2699
GROUP BY FLOOR(offense_code/100) WITH ROLLUP;

SELECT HOUR(begin_time) AS hour, COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM incident
WHERE begin_time BETWEEN '2006-09-04 00:00:00' AND '2006-09-04 23:59:59'
AND offense_code <= 2699
GROUP BY HOUR(begin_time) WITH ROLLUP;
